# FoursquareClone

In Atil Samancioglu's swift training course, I have learned how to clone Foursquare. I created an FoursquareClone App. User have tableview and may pin their favourite locations also they can add photo of the place and some other details. 

In this project I have learned,

- how to work with Parse(sending and pulling data)
- how to work with Map(adding annotations, navigation etc.)
- how to work with singleton structure
